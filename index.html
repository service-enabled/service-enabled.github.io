			<li>Meet monthly and stick with Tuesday, but move up to 5:30pm.</li>
			<li>Use the same space in Franklin for next meeting.</li>
			<li>We'd like to spend time on: open source, hacking on code, war stories, and cover special topics as they arise.</li>
			<li>For open source code we're leaning towards MIT license.</li>
			<li>Hacking on group owned code outside of the group meeting is okay as long as there's a PR or issue so that the group knows what you're working on.</li>
			<li>See how the next 1 or 2 meetups go then create a meetup page.</li>
			<li>Hacked on a project to add unique id's to requests.</li>
